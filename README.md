deep_learning
==============================

For this project you will need some dependencies.
The project uses python 3.8, and all dependencies can be installed with `poetry` if you are using that with `poetry install`.

If you prefer to use `pip` you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The lessons can be found inside the `notebooks`folder.
The source code for the lessons can be found in the `src`folder.
